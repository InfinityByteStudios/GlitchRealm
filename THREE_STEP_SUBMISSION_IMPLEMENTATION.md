# Three-Step Game Submission Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 3-step game submission flow that separates basic information from extended details, making it easier for creators to submit rich game content.

## Implementation Details

### Step Flow
1. **Step 1: Requirements & Guidelines** - User must read and accept submission guidelines
2. **Step 2: Basic Game Info** - Required fields (title, description, play URL, cover image, tags, badge)
3. **Step 3: Extended Details** - Optional fields (extended description, how to play, screenshots)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Step Indicator (`submit-game.html`)
- Added third step to the visual indicator
- Updated CSS classes for 3-step progression (active, completed states)
- Added `step3` and `line2` elements

#### 2. Form Restructuring
Split single form into two separate cards:

**Basic Info Card (`basicInfoCard`):**
- Title (required, max 120 chars)
- Cover Image (file upload or URL)
- Short Description (required, max 1000 chars) - appears on game cards
- Play URL (required, must be http/https)
- Tags (up to 3)
- Badge (NEW/UPDATED/BETA)

**Extended Details Card (`extendedDetailsCard`):**
- Extended Description (optional, max 10000 chars) - detailed game info for detail page
- How to Play (optional, max 5000 chars) - instructions and controls
- Screenshots (up to 10 URLs) - gallery on detail page

#### 3. Navigation Flow
- **Step 1 → Step 2**: "Next: Basic Info" button (requires checkbox acceptance)
- **Step 2 → Step 1**: "← Back to Requirements" button
- **Step 2 → Step 3**: "Next: Extended Details" button
- **Step 3 → Step 2**: "← Back to Basic Info" button
- **Step 3**: "Submit Game" button (final submission)

**Clickable Step Numbers:** ⭐ NEW
- Users can click on completed step numbers to jump back to previous steps
- **Step 1**: Clickable when completed or active
- **Step 2**: Clickable when completed or active  
- **Step 3**: Only clickable when active (can't skip ahead)
- Visual feedback: Completed steps glow on hover with scale animation
- Disabled steps appear dimmed and show "not-allowed" cursor

#### 4. JavaScript Updates
- `updateStepIndicator(currentStep)`: Now handles 3 steps with proper state management
- `gate()`: Updated to manage 3 cards (requirementsCard, basicInfoCard, extendedDetailsCard)
- Navigation handlers: Added 4 button event listeners for bidirectional navigation
- **`navigateToStep(targetStep)`**: New function to jump directly to any step ⭐
- **Step click handlers**: Event listeners on each step number for direct navigation ⭐
- Form submission: Updated to collect up to 10 screenshot URLs

#### 5. Screenshot Collection
Changed from 5 to 10 screenshot inputs:
```javascript
const screenshots = [
  $('screenshot1')?.value.trim(),
  // ... through screenshot10
].filter(url => url && /^https?:\/\//i.test(url)).slice(0, 10);
```

### Integration with Detail Pages

#### Game Cards → Detail Page
Game cards in `games.html` already have click handlers:
```javascript
card.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  // Don't navigate if clicking buttons or menu
  if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON' || ...) return;
  window.location.href = `game-detail.html?id=${id}`;
});
```

#### Detail Page Display (`game-detail.html`)
The detail page already handles all extended fields:
- **Extended Description**: Conditionally displayed if present
- **How to Play**: Shown in dedicated section with formatting
- **Screenshots**: Gallery grid with lightbox viewer
- All sections hidden if no data exists (graceful degradation)

### Field Limits & Validation

| Field | Max Length | Required | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Title | 120 chars | Yes | Displayed on cards |
| Description | 1000 chars | Yes | Short description for cards |
| Extended Description | 10000 chars | No | Full details for detail page |
| How to Play | 5000 chars | No | Instructions section |
| Play URL | 2000 chars | Yes | Must be http/https |
| Tags | 3 tags, 20 chars each | No | Genre/category tags |
| Screenshots | 10 URLs, 2000 chars each | No | Gallery images |

### Firestore Rules
Already configured to accept:
- `extendedDescription`: max 10000 chars
- `howToPlay`: max 5000 chars
- `screenshots`: array, max 10 items

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Users only see extended fields after completing basics
2. **Clear Context**: Each step explains what information is needed and why
3. **Visual Progress**: Step indicator shows current position in flow
4. **Easy Navigation**: Back buttons allow reviewing/editing previous steps
5. **Smart Validation**: Required fields only on step 2, step 3 is fully optional
6. **Helpful Hints**: Field descriptions explain where content appears (card vs detail page)
7. **Clickable Steps**: Users can click completed step numbers to jump back instantly ⭐
8. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects on clickable steps with glow and scale animations ⭐
9. **Persistent Acceptance**: Checkbox stays checked when navigating back to step 1 ⭐
10. **Seamless Flow**: No re-acceptance needed - users can freely navigate after initial acceptance ⭐
