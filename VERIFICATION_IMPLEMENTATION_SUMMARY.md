# Verification System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Verification System
✅ Users can now request verification for **Games**, **News**, or **Both**
✅ Users choose a **username** during verification that will be shown for attribution
✅ Username appears as "Made by [username]" for games and "By [username]" for articles

### 2. Updated Firestore Security Rules
**File:** `firestore.rules`

✅ Added `username` field (max 50 chars) to verification requests
✅ Added `verificationTypes` array to verification requests
✅ Added `username` and `verificationTypes` to verified_users collection
✅ Added `ownerUsername` field to game_submissions
✅ Added `authorUsername` field to news_articles
✅ Updated validation functions to support new fields

### 3. Updated User Portal
**File:** `user-portal.html`

✅ Added username input field (required, shown as attribution)
✅ Added verification type checkboxes (Games and/or News)
✅ Updated form submission to include username and verification types
✅ Updated form to pre-fill existing verification request data
✅ Added validation to ensure at least one verification type is selected

### 4. Updated Game Submission
**File:** `submit-game.html`

✅ Automatically fetches and stores the verified username when submitting a game
✅ Falls back to displayName or email if no verified username exists
✅ Stores `ownerUsername` field in game_submissions document

### 5. Updated News Publishing
**File:** `news/publish.js`

✅ Imports the verified-user-helper module
✅ Fetches verified username before publishing
✅ Stores `authorUsername` field in news_articles document

### 6. Created Helper Module
**File:** `verified-user-helper.js`

New utility functions:
- `getVerifiedUserData(uid)` - Get all verified user data
- `getVerifiedUsername(uid)` - Get just the username
- `isVerifiedForType(uid, type)` - Check if verified for games/news
- `getDisplayName(uid, fallback)` - Get display name with fallback
- `getCachedUsername(uid)` - Get username with caching

### 7. Documentation
**File:** `VERIFICATION_SYSTEM.md`

Complete documentation including:
- User guide for requesting verification
- Database schema details
- Security rules explanation
- Admin workflow for approving/denying requests
- Helper function usage
- Migration notes for existing content
- Testing procedures
- FAQ

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. Go to User Portal → Verification Section
2. Enter a **username** (this shows as "Made by [username]")
3. Choose verification type: **Games**, **News**, or **Both**
4. Fill out optional details (display name, bio, links)
5. Submit for review

### For Admins:
1. Review verification requests in moderation panel
2. Approve or deny the request
3. System creates `verified_users` entry with username and types
4. User can now submit games and/or publish articles (based on types)

### For Content Attribution:
- **Games**: When a verified user submits a game, their username is automatically stored as `ownerUsername`
- **Articles**: When a verified user publishes an article, their username is automatically stored as `authorUsername`
- This username then displays as "Made by [username]" or "By [username]"

## Next Steps

### Required Actions:

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Update Moderation Panel** (if you have one)
   - Add UI to show `verificationTypes` in verification requests
   - Add UI to show `username` in verification requests
   - When approving, copy `username` and `verificationTypes` to `verified_users`

3. **Update Game Card Display** (games.html or wherever games are shown)
   - Check for `ownerUsername` field
   - Display "Made by [ownerUsername]" instead of hardcoded studio names
   - For legacy games without username, use fallback

4. **Update Article Display** (news pages)
   - Check for `authorUsername` field
   - Display "By [authorUsername]"
   - For legacy articles without username, use fallback

5. **Optional: Migration Script**
   - Create a script to add usernames to existing content
   - See VERIFICATION_SYSTEM.md for example code

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in as test user
- [ ] Request verification with username "TestCreator"
- [ ] Select "Games" verification type
- [ ] Verify request document created in Firestore
- [ ] Sign in as admin
- [ ] Approve the verification request
- [ ] Verify `verified_users` entry created with correct username
- [ ] Sign in as verified user
- [ ] Submit a test game
- [ ] Verify `ownerUsername` is "TestCreator" in Firestore
- [ ] Check game displays "Made by TestCreator"
- [ ] (If news verification) Publish test article
- [ ] Verify `authorUsername` is "TestCreator" in Firestore
- [ ] Check article displays "By TestCreator"

## Files Modified

1. `firestore.rules` - Security rules for new fields
2. `user-portal.html` - Verification form with username and types
3. `submit-game.html` - Auto-fetch and store owner username
4. `news/publish.js` - Auto-fetch and store author username

## Files Created

1. `verified-user-helper.js` - Helper utilities for verified users
2. `VERIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` - Complete documentation

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **None** - All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing game submissions without `ownerUsername` will continue to work
- Existing articles without `authorUsername` will continue to work
- New optional fields don't break existing validation

## Notes

- The username field is **required** for new verification requests
- At least one verification type must be selected
- Usernames are stored when content is created/submitted
- Helper module includes caching to reduce Firestore reads
- All fields are properly validated in security rules
