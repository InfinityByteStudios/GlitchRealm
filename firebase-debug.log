Leave empty if you don't use Cloud Firestore.\nEnter the full paths, separated by commas. Use `{UID}` as a placeholder for the user's UID.\nFor example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each collection has documents with User ID as document IDs, then enter `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.\n\n* Cloud Firestore delete mode: (Only applicable if you use the `Cloud Firestore paths` parameter.) How do you want to delete Cloud Firestore documents? To also delete documents in subcollections, set this parameter to `recursive`.\n\n* Realtime Database instance: What is the ID of the Realtime Database instance from which you want to delete user data (keyed on user ID)?\n\n\n* Realtime Database location: (Only applicable if you provided the `Realtime Database instance` parameter.) From which Realtime Database location do you want to delete data keyed on a user ID?\n\n\n* Realtime Database paths: Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain data keyed on a user ID? Leave empty if you don't use Realtime Database.\nEnter the full paths, separated by commas. Use `{UID}` as a placeholder for the user's UID.\nFor example: `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.\n\n* Cloud Storage bucket: Which Google Cloud Storage bucket do you want to delete files from?\n\n\n* Cloud Storage paths: Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store data keyed on a user ID? Leave empty if you don't use Cloud Storage.\nEnter the full paths to files or directories in your Storage buckets, separated by commas. Use `{UID}` to represent the User ID of the deleted user, and use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default Storage bucket.\nHere's a series of examples. To delete all the files in your default bucket with the file naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`, enter `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`. To also delete all the files in another bucket called my-app-logs with the file naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`, enter `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`. To *also* delete a User ID-labeled directory and all its files (like `media/{UID}`), enter `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt,{DEFAULT}/media/{UID}`.\n\n* Enable auto discovery: Enable the extension to automatically discover Firestore collections and documents to delete.\n\n* Auto discovery search depth: If auto discovery is enabled, how deep should auto discovery find collections and documents. For example, setting to `1` would only discover root collections and documents, whereas setting to `9` would search sub-collections 9 levels deep. Defaults to `3`.\n\n* Auto discovery search fields: If auto discovery is enabled, specify what document fields are used to associate the UID with the document. The extension will delete documents where the value for one or more of these fields matches the deleting user’s UID. If left empty, document fields will not be used in auto discovery.\n\n* Search function URL: Specify a URL to call that will return a list of document paths to delete. The extension will send a `POST` request to the specified `URL`, with the `uid` of the deleted user will be provided in the body of the request. The endpoint specified should return an array of firestore paths to delete.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **clearData:** Listens for user accounts to be deleted from your project's authenticated users, then removes any associated user data (based on Firebase Authentication's User ID) from Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and/or Cloud Storage.\n\n* **handleSearch:** undefined\n\n* **handleDeletion:** undefined\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.owner (Reason: Allows the extension to delete (user) data from Cloud Firestore.)\n\n* firebasedatabase.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to delete (user) data from Realtime Database.)\n\n* storage.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to delete (user) data from Cloud Storage.)\n\n* pubsub.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to publish and subscribe to PubSub events.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/shared-sign-in/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/(default)).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `infinitybyte.dev@gmail.com`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"infinitybyte.dev@gmail.com\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2Finfinitybyte.dev@gmail.com\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","extensionRef":"firebase/firestore-send-email","extensionVersion":"0.2.4","systemParams":{"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnectorEgressSettings":"VPC_CONNECTOR_EGRESS_SETTINGS_UNSPECIFIED","firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/minInstances":"0","firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/location":"us-central1","firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function/memory":"256Mi"}},"errorStatus":{"code":13,"message":"; RESOURCE_ERROR at /deployments/firebase-ext-firestore-send-email/resources/processQueue: {\"ResourceType\":\"gcp-types/cloudfunctions-v2beta:projects.locations.functions\",\"ResourceErrorCode\":\"400\",\"ResourceErrorMessage\":{\"code\":400,\"message\":\"Validation failed for trigger projects/shared-sign-in/locations/eur3/triggers/ext-firestore-send-email-processqueue-337404: The request was invalid: generic::invalid_argument: Database '(default)' does not exist in region 'eur3'.
