# Auth Redirect System Improvements

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: When users sign in from the games page, they were being redirected to the home page instead of staying on the games page after authentication.

**Root Cause**: The auth system wasn't properly preserving and passing the return URL through the OAuth flow, especially when using the auth subdomain.

## Solution Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive auth redirect system that ensures users return to their original page after signing in, regardless of which authentication method they use.
