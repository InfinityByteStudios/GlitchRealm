# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive performance optimizations for the GlitchRealm gaming platform to reduce page jank, lower memory/GC pressure during gameplay, improve image loading and Core Web Vitals (LCP/FCP), and reduce per-frame allocations. The optimization maintains backwards compatibility and does not weaken Firestore security while targeting specific performance metrics across mobile and desktop experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user on a 3G connection, I want pages to load quickly with minimal layout shifts, so that I can access games and content without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page on 3G mobile emulation THEN the First Contentful Paint (FCP) SHALL be <= 1.5 seconds
2. WHEN a user loads any page THEN the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) SHALL be <= 2.5 seconds  
3. WHEN a user navigates through the site THEN the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) SHALL be < 0.1
4. WHEN images load on any page THEN they SHALL have proper width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts
5. WHEN a user signs in or loads content THEN the full interface SHALL load without requiring hard refresh
6. WHEN loading states occur THEN they SHALL not get stuck showing only logos or partial content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gamer playing on GlitchRealm, I want smooth gameplay without frame drops or performance issues, so that my gaming experience is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is actively playing games THEN mean frame drops SHALL be < 5% during gameplay
2. WHEN DOM mutations occur THEN they SHALL be batched to reduce per-frame allocations
3. WHEN expensive operations are performed THEN they SHALL be deferred to idle time using requestIdleCallback
4. WHEN images are processed THEN naturalWidth checks SHALL not cause forced reflows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining GlitchRealm, I want centralized configuration and logging controls, so that I can debug issues without impacting production performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL use a centralized dev-config.js for developer settings
2. WHEN logging occurs in production THEN verbose console logs SHALL be disabled for non-developer users
3. WHEN a developer user is authenticated THEN debug logging SHALL be available through isDev() checks
4. WHEN the system starts THEN DEV_UIDS SHALL be managed from a single configuration file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user browsing community content, I want fast loading of posts and verified badges, so that I can quickly see relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verified badges are loaded THEN they SHALL use batch loading to reduce Firestore queries
2. WHEN text content is processed THEN regex patterns SHALL be pre-compiled and cached
3. WHEN DOM references are needed THEN they SHALL be cached in long-lived contexts
4. WHEN moderation checks occur THEN they SHALL use hoisted utilities to avoid repeated allocations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want Firebase operations to be optimized, so that database costs are minimized and performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple verified status checks are needed THEN they SHALL be batched into single Firestore queries
2. WHEN concurrent requests for the same data occur THEN they SHALL be deduplicated
3. WHEN Firestore queries are made THEN they SHALL batch up to 10 documents per request where possible
4. WHEN playtime sync operations occur THEN they SHALL include early returns for no-op scenarios

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want automated performance monitoring and code quality checks, so that performance regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN ESLint SHALL enforce performance-related rules
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN Lighthouse CI SHALL run performance audits
3. WHEN performance budgets are exceeded THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail with clear feedback
4. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL validate FCP, LCP, and CLS metrics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want optimized image loading and rendering, so that pages load quickly and don't shift content around.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical images load THEN they SHALL be preloaded in the document head
2. WHEN game card images render THEN they SHALL have aspect-ratio CSS to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL include loading="lazy" and decoding="async" attributes
4. WHEN responsive images are needed THEN they SHALL use srcset for appropriate sizing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all optimizations to maintain security and compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work without vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN Firestore security rules SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN data formats are processed THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN bundle size increase SHALL be <= 5%
4. WHEN any code changes are made THEN the Games folder and all its contents SHALL be completely untouched (CRITICAL CONSTRAINT)
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN all changes SHALL be easily reversible with provided steps

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to Netlify, I want optimizations that work seamlessly with Netlify's open source hosting plan, so that performance improvements don't conflict with the hosting environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are deployed THEN they SHALL be compatible with Netlify's static hosting
2. WHEN CI/CD workflows run THEN they SHALL work within Netlify's build environment constraints
3. WHEN assets are optimized THEN they SHALL work with Netlify's CDN and caching mechanisms
4. WHEN redirects or headers are needed THEN they SHALL use Netlify's _redirects and _headers files
