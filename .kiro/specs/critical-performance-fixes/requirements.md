# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the most critical performance bottlenecks identified in Lighthouse audits that are preventing GlitchRealm from achieving optimal Core Web Vitals scores. The focus is on image optimization (18.27s potential savings), JavaScript bundle optimization (6.59s potential savings), and network payload reduction to achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90+ and meet Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on any connection speed, I want images to load quickly in modern formats, so that pages don't take 18+ seconds to fully load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are served THEN they SHALL be in WebP or AVIF format with fallbacks to original formats
2. WHEN large images (>1920px) are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically resized to appropriate dimensions
3. WHEN images are requested THEN they SHALL be properly sized for their display context (no oversized images)
4. WHEN critical images load THEN they SHALL be preloaded and optimized for LCP improvement
5. WHEN users are on slow connections THEN image quality SHALL be automatically adjusted
6. WHEN images are converted THEN the conversion process SHALL maintain visual quality while reducing file size by 60-80%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user loading the website, I want minimal JavaScript to be downloaded and executed, so that the site becomes interactive quickly without blocking the main thread.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript bundles are analyzed THEN unused code SHALL be identified and removed (targeting 3.55s savings)
2. WHEN duplicate modules are detected THEN they SHALL be deduplicated (targeting 3.04s savings)
3. WHEN Firebase libraries are loaded THEN only required modules SHALL be included
4. WHEN third-party scripts load THEN they SHALL be deferred or loaded asynchronously
5. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN main thread blocking time SHALL be < 300ms
6. WHEN code splitting is possible THEN non-critical JavaScript SHALL be loaded on-demand

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the largest contentful paint to occur quickly, so that I can see the main content without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) SHALL be <= 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN critical resources are identified THEN they SHALL be preloaded in the correct priority order
3. WHEN render-blocking resources exist THEN they SHALL be eliminated or made non-blocking
4. WHEN the LCP element is identified THEN its image SHALL be preloaded and optimized
5. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN they SHALL use font-display: swap to prevent invisible text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer deploying optimizations, I want automated tools to convert and optimize assets, so that manual optimization work is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are added to the project THEN they SHALL be automatically converted to modern formats during build
2. WHEN JavaScript is bundled THEN tree-shaking SHALL remove unused code automatically
3. WHEN assets are deployed THEN they SHALL be compressed and optimized by the build process
4. WHEN performance budgets are exceeded THEN the build SHALL fail with clear feedback
5. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN they SHALL be validated automatically in CI/CD

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user browsing the site, I want network requests to be minimized and efficient, so that data usage is reduced and loading is faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple small assets exist THEN they SHALL be bundled or inlined where appropriate
2. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN they SHALL use HTTP/2 multiplexing effectively
3. WHEN resources are cached THEN cache headers SHALL be optimized for each asset type
4. WHEN third-party resources are loaded THEN they SHALL be from CDNs with proper preconnect hints
5. WHEN the total network payload exceeds 1MB THEN it SHALL be reduced through compression and optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want to maintain compatibility with Netlify hosting while achieving optimal performance, so that deployment and hosting costs remain manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN they SHALL work within Netlify's build and hosting constraints
2. WHEN asset optimization occurs THEN it SHALL leverage Netlify's built-in optimization features
3. WHEN caching is configured THEN it SHALL use Netlify's CDN effectively
4. WHEN build processes run THEN they SHALL complete within Netlify's time limits
5. WHEN performance monitoring is set up THEN it SHALL integrate with Netlify Analytics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want performance optimizations to be maintainable and not break existing functionality, so that future development is not hindered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN new features are added THEN performance SHALL not regress significantly
3. WHEN optimization tools are configured THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging info
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN optimizations SHALL be easily reversible
5. WHEN the Games folder is present THEN it SHALL remain completely untouched (CRITICAL CONSTRAINT)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site from different devices and network conditions, I want consistent performance across all scenarios, so that the experience is reliable regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN performance SHALL meet mobile Core Web Vitals thresholds
2. WHEN accessed on slow networks (3G) THEN critical content SHALL load within 3 seconds
3. WHEN accessed on fast networks THEN the full experience SHALL load within 1 second
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN basic content SHALL still be accessible
5. WHEN modern browsers are used THEN advanced optimizations SHALL be applied
6. WHEN legacy browsers are used THEN graceful fallbacks SHALL be provided
